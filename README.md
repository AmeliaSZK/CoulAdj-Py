# Colour Adjacencies
Reads an image and outputs the colour adjacencies.

Primary objective is to help me learn Python. 

This project declares conformity to [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
There is currently no API version number, because there has been no public release.

**This project is still in development and is not ready for public consumption.**

"Colour" and "color" will be used interchangeably and arbitrarily in both the code
and documentation.

Long term objective is to publish as a module on PIP.

# About this Github repository

*   I made this Github repository public so I could share with my twitter friends.
*   It may be made private in the future.

# Known or Assumed Requirements

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
    * Development was done with the Individual Edition (Distribution)
    * _NB: Upon install, Anaconda will modify your command line prompt to prefix
        it with the active environment in parenthesis._

# How to run

**NB: These instructions have not been tested on Windows**

## First time setup
1. Clone the git repository
1. On the command line, navigate to the cloned repository
1. Run this command:
    ```
    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

## To Run
1. On the command line, navigate to the cloned repository
1. Activate the Anaconda environment:
    ```
    $ conda activate CoulAdj-Py
    (CoulAdj-Py) $
    ```
1. Run the program:
    ```
    (CoulAdj-Py) $ python CoulAdj-Py.py path/to/image.png path/to/results.tsv
    ```

To get the full command line usage help message:
```
(CoulAdj-Py) $ python CoulAdj-Py.py -h
usage: CoulAdj-Py.py [-h] [-d] [-v] [-n] image results

Computes, for each colour in the image, the list of all adjacent colours and writes the results to a TSV file.

positional arguments:
  image                 The image file to process.
  results               The TSV file in which to write the results. 
                        If it already exists, it will be erased and overwritten.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --dont-relate-diagonals
                        if present, will only consider the 4 neighbours with a 
                        common edge (top, bottom, left, right) to be adjacent. 
                        By default, all 8 neighbours are considered adjacent
  -v, --verbose         display informations about the file and the computations
  -n, --version         show program's version number and exit

*(This example may not be up-to-date)*

Regardless of wether or not the above example is up-to-date, these
characteristics of the command line interface are *not* subject to change:
* The last argument is the results file.
* The second-to-last argument is the image file.
* The `--dont-relate-diagonals` flag will enable the `--dont-relate-diagonals` option.

# Tests
There are two tests you can run: correctness and performance.
Run the commands from the root of the repository.

## Correctness
Will run the program on small samples and report when finished.
Will also report a failing test.


### Good
```
(CoulAdj-Py) $ bash test-corr.sh
Correctness test finished
```

### Bad
```
(CoulAdj-Py) $ bash test-corr.sh
Size 1 failed
Correctness test finished
```

## Performance
Will run a few samples of different sizes. Check the source of `test-perf.sh`
to see which sizes are activated. ("activated" means "not commented")

Execution time of each sample will be printed.
Failing tests will be signaled.
Completion of all tests will also be reported.

### Good
```
(CoulAdj-Py) $ bash test-perf.sh
Size 128: 0.692
Size 256: 2.73
Performance test finished
```
Notice that doubling the size quadrupled the execution time.
This is expected, because when the size doubles, the number of pixels quadruples.
It means the implementation is O(n).

Also, the size closest to the intended input is 512. 
4 times 2.73s is 10.92s, which is a good (but not excellent) execution time.

### Okay
```
(CoulAdj-Py) $ bash test-perf.sh
Size 16: 0.702
Size 32: 2.71
Size 64: 10.9
Size 128: 43.1
Performance test finished
```
The actual performance at the time of writing these lines.
It's definitely not good, because at these rates, the size 512 will take
11 minutes to complete. 

It is, however, not *bad*, because since execution time is still quadrupling,
we are still in O(n).

### Bad
```
(CoulAdj-Py) $ bash test-perf.sh
Size 16: 0.692
Size 32: 5.5
Performance test finished
```
The implementation under test is O(nÂ²), and the intended use-case has an `n` of 13M... ðŸ˜¶

### Unacceptable
```
(CoulAdj-Py) $ bash test-perf.sh
Size 128: 0.692
Size 128 failed
Size 256: 2.73
Size 256 failed
Performance test finished
```
A program can be so slow that it becomes useless, but an incorrect program
is worse than useless. 


# API

## Input 
*   Source image file path
*   Destination file path
*   Option(s)
    * `--dont-relate-diagonals`
        * If present, only consider as adjacent the four (4) neighbours with
        a common edge. (top, bottom, left, and right neighbours)
        * By default, all 8 neighbours are considered adjacent.

## Known limitations
*   (none yet)


## Output
*   TSV File
*   Python native object (maybe?)

### TSV File
*   Tab-separated values (tsv)
    *   [Summary on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) 
    *   [Official specifications](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/tab-separated-values)

*   Data will be organized like this:

    |r  |g  |b  |a  |adj_r|adj_g|adj_b|adj_a|
    |---|---|---|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|
    |0  |32 |64 |128|0    |0    |0    |255  |
    |0  |32 |64 |255|0    |0    |0    |255  |
    |0  |32 |64 |255|0    |32   |0    |255  |
    |0  |64 |0  |255|0    |0    |0    |255  |

*   The alpha column will always be included in the output. Images without an alpha channel
will get an alpha value at full opacity.

    |r  |g  |b  |a  |adj_r|adj_g|adj_b|adj_a|
    |---|---|---|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|
    |0  |32 |64 |255|0    |0    |0    |255  |
    |0  |32 |64 |255|0    |32   |0    |255  |
    |0  |64 |0  |255|0    |0    |0    |255  |


*   The rows will be sorted in ascending order.

    |r  |g  |b  |a  |adj_r|adj_g|adj_b|adj_a|
    |---|---|---|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|
    |0  |32 |64 |255|0    |0    |0    |255  |
    |0  |32 |64 |255|0    |32   |0    |255  |
    |0  |32 |64 |255|0    |128  |0    |255  |
    |0  |64 |0  |255|0    |0    |0    |255  |
    |32 |0  |0  |255|0    |0    |0    |255  |
    |255|0  |0  |255|0    |0    |0    |255  |

*   Symmetric relations will be included;
if A is adjacent to B, then B is adjacent to A, 
so this single relation will generate two rows.

    |r  |g  |b  |a  |adj_r|adj_g|adj_b|adj_a|
    |---|---|---|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|
    |0  |0  |0  |255|0    |64   |0    |255  |
    |0  |64 |0  |255|0    |0    |0    |255  |

*   Reflexive relations will *not* be included;
a color cannot be adjacent with itself.

*   Colors that differ only in their alpha value are considered distinct.

    |r  |g  |b  |a  |adj_r|adj_g|adj_b|adj_a|
    |---|---|---|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|
    |0  |0  |0  |128|0    |0    |0    |255  |
    |0  |0  |0  |255|0    |0    |0    |128  |

*   Columns will appear in this order:
    - Red
    - Green
    - Blue
    - Alpha
    - Adjacent Red
    - Adjacent Green
    - Adjacent Blue
    - Adjacent Alpha

*   The first row will contain the column names.
*   The column names will be:

    |Column Name|Color Channel  |
    |-----------|---------------|
    | `r`       |Red            |
    | `g`       |Green          |
    | `b`       |Blue           |
    | `a`       |Alpha          |
    | `adj_r`   |Adjacent Red   |
    | `adj_g`   |Adjacent Green |
    | `adj_b`   |Adjacent Blue  |
    | `adj_a`   |Adjacent Alpha |

*   The line-endings may be either in Windows (CRLF) or Unix (LF) style.

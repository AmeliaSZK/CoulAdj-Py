Name	Time	Desc
Base	0.700*	Baseline. All times with a * are an average of 10 measurements. Sample size 16.
Consts	0.719*	Replaced offset literals with named constants.
Half	0.397*	Only process forward neighbours, and register both A->B and B->A
Sep1	0.402*	Separated corners, edge, & center. But no change to validations, so no boost expected.

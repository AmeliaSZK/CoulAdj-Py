Name	Time	Desc
Base	0.700*	Baseline. All times with a * are an average of 10 measurements. Sample size 16.
Consts	0.719*	Replaced offset literals with named constants.
Half	0.397*	Only process forward neighbours, and register both A->B and B->A
Sep1	0.402*	Separated corners, edge, & center. But no change to validations, so no boost expected.
Sep2	0.382*	Removed neighbour check for center pixels.
Diag1	0.380*	Fixed diagonals bug. (omg... ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)
Diag2	0.376*	Removed diagonals check from every pixel.
Clean1	0.380*	Removed commented code. (no boost expected)
Base_8	0.119*	Tested with sample size 8. No change to the code.
Base_16	0.372*	Sample size 16. Equivalent to Clean1
Base_32	1.399*	Sample size 32.
Base_64	5.527*	Sample size 64.
Clean1b	0.376*	Reverted test script to Clean1
Numpy1	0.505*	Used proper Numpy functions to process. Probably not at Numpy's limit yet.
Decoup	0.507*	Decoupled data types in calculations from crafting of the output

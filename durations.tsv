Name	Time	Desc
Base	0.700*	Baseline. All times with a * are an average of 10 measurements. Sample size 16.
Consts	0.719*	Replaced offset literals with named constants.
Half	0.397*	Only process forward neighbours, and register both A->B and B->A
Sep1	0.402*	Separated corners, edge, & center. But no change to validations, so no boost expected.
Sep2	0.382*	Removed neighbour check for center pixels.
Diag1	0.380*	Fixed diagonals bug. (omg... ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)
Diag2	0.376*	Removed diagonals check from every pixel.
Clean1	0.380*	Removed commented code. (no boost expected)
Base_8	0.119*	Tested with sample size 8. No change to the code.
Base_16	0.372*	Sample size 16. Equivalent to Clean1
Base_32	1.399*	Sample size 32.
Base_64	5.527*	Sample size 64.
Clean1b	0.376*	Reverted test script to Clean1
Numpy1	0.505*	Used proper Numpy functions to process. Probably not at Numpy's limit yet.
Decoup	0.507*	Decoupled data types in calculations from crafting of the output
Numpy2	0.512*	Removed special casing for corners and edges
Consts2	0.496*	Removed variables for slicing
Func	0.500*	Removed 1 indirection for conversion functions
Func2	0.499*	Reverted to Consts2
Comp1	0.097*	No conversion, but use of (a != b).any(axis=2) to compare
Clean2	0.099*	Removed obsolete timer. (I worried it was affecting measurements)
BaseP	20.4	New baseline. Input is the proprietary warhammer_map_1_1_shadow.bmp
Func3	20.7	Skipped intermediary variables in colourKey_from_pixelData
Func4	21.0	Reverted to BaseP
Tupl	6.07	Now using tuples to store colour keys
Tupl2	5.71	Skipped intermediary variables (yes, again)
Tupl3	5.68	Reverted to Tupl. Skipping intermediary variables definitely useless
Tupl4	5.63	RGB (no alpha) tuples now have only 3 items
